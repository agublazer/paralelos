Compile:
$ mpicc −g −Wall −o mpi_hello mpi_hello.c
Many systems also support program startup with mpiexec:
$ mpiexec −n <number of processes> ./mpi hello
So to run the program with one process, we’d type
$ mpiexec −n 1 ./mpi hello
and to run the program with four processes, we’d type
$ mpiexec −n 4 ./mpi hello
